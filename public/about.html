<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Zhiyi, and I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to introduce myself. 
  I hold an undergraduate degree in Business Administration, which equipped me with a solid foundation in the 
  corporate world. However, my passion for technology and its limitless possibilities led me to embark on a 
  new journey. Currently, I am pursuing a graduate degree in Computer Science, where I am exploring the 
  exciting realms of artificial intelligence and software development. Before diving into the world of coding,
   I spent four enriching years in the marketing field, where I honed my communication and strategic thinking 
   skills.

  Beyond academics and career, I find my true happiness in various hobbies. Tennis and snowboarding are my 
  go-to sports, which allow me to stay active, challenge myself, and find a sense of tranquility in nature. 
  Whenever possible, I make sure to indulge in beach vacations, soaking up the sun and enjoying the serene 
  ocean waves. Additionally, I have a profound love for literature, movies, and photography. Books offer me 
  a gateway to different worlds and perspectives, while movies captivate my imagination. My camera is my 
  constant companion, enabling me to capture beautiful moments and express myself creatively.

<p>Born in China and currently residing in Seattle, I have been fortunate to experience diverse cultures and 
  meet inspiring individuals along the way. I am eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing 
  positively to the ever-evolving world of technology. I look forward to connecting with like-minded 
  individuals and collectively embracing the opportunities that lie ahead.
